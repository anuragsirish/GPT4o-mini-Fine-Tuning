# Real Estate Use Case: Fine-Tuning a Machine Learning Model

![Fine-Tuning in Action](./images/A_detailed_illustration_of_a_data_scientist_workin.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a machine learning model for a real estate use case. The model is designed to assist real estate agents in efficiently searching for property information, providing concise and relevant responses to their queries.

### Features

- **Data Preparation:** Learn how to structure your training and validation datasets in JSONL format.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Step-by-step guide to fine-tuning a model using a specific real estate dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Methods for validating the model's performance on new data.
- **Deployment:** Tips for deploying the fine-tuned model in a production environment.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-fine-tuning.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd real-estate-fine-tuning
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/real_estate_fine_tuning.ipynb
   ```

### Fine-Tuning Process

The Jupyter Notebook guides you through the following steps:
